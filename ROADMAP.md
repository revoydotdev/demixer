End-to-end music deconstruction tool: separates a song into stems (Demucs), transcribes each to MIDI, analyzes tempo/key/chords/harmony, engraves a score, and exports Reaper/.dawproject/FL Studio projects — all packed into a single `.demixer` archive. Python 3.11 CLI with an optional PySide6 desktop shell.

## Current phase

Post-audit hardening — the full pipeline runs end-to-end (exit 0 across 20+ genres, all engine backends); 14 bugs found and fixed in a deep audit pass (2026-05-24); accuracy validated against Isophonics ground truth (key 0.763, tempo 0.916, chord majmin 0.752 with BTC). Version 0.0.1, AGPL-3.0, 129 passing tests.

Outstanding work:
- **PySide6 GUI**: interaction logic wired — file picker, live pipeline progress, and an output file tree reflecting the real run output (smoke-tested).
- **ADTOF drums**: shipped opt-in (`--drums adtof`, onset-F1 0.975 vs 0.825 spectral); not promoted to default pending an ear-check on real-stem class accuracy.
- **YourMT3+ polyphony**: upgrade path researched and attempted; blocked by upstream breakage (inference adapter broken, pytorch-port LFS smudge broken as of 2026-05-24).
- **Score engraving quality**: current fixed 16th-grid quantization is robust but naive; learned rhythm quantization (arXiv:2508.19262) identified as the highest perceived-quality gain — medium-high effort, deferred.
